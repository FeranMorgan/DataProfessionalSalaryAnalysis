# DataProfessionalSalarySurvey
An EDA project focused on comparing and contrasting the salaries of data professionals from around the world with particular emphasis on the US.

The largest factors correlating with salary were the country in which the survey participant worked and their job title. Additionally, data professionals in the US earn between $10,00-$40,000 more compared to the other top 5 responding countries in the survey regardless of experience or education, with no significant differences in salary between those holding a Bachelor's degree compared to a PhD.
