These are possibly volunteers or unpaid interns of some kind, or possibly those who declined to give their salary information, all of which are not useful for our purpose and can be safely discarded. Additionally, Salaries that are two standard deviations above the mean are pretty unlikely and those should be discarded as well to avoid skewing the analysis."

Unfortunately, since the postal code column was optional, only around a third of participants supplied this information. \n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "Throughout the analysis it became apparent that the average data professionals in the US survey are college graduates with Bachelor's degrees, less than 10 years of experience in similar roles, and make around $100,000 per year. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, despite the apparent fact that education, years of experience, and job title don't determine a person's salary alone or together, there are a lot of places for improvement: \n",
    "\n",
    "    Firstly, the sample here was small and may not accurately represent the true population.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Secondly, it's possible that other factors do make significant differences in salary. This means that something like location inside the US or a particular skillset may be useful in determining how much a data professional makes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Thirdly, A more rigorous analysis with a larger dataset in the future may uncover a relationship between the present features and be able to predict them with some reasonable accuracy.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Questions for future exploration:\n",
    "\n",
    "    What role does location in the US and skillset play in determining salary?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    What significant factors exist that were not captured by this dataset? \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Is the data industry relatively well balanced in terms of salary for most roles and experience levels?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    How does salary compare to total compensation packages?\n",
    "    \n",
